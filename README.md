This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle errors in asynchronous operations. The `bug.js` file shows an Express app with an asynchronous function (`someAsyncOperation`) that might throw an error.  Crucially, it lacks a `catch` block to handle this error.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected code, demonstrating proper error handling with a `catch` block.
